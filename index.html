        <p>Growing up, I spent most of my time outdoors exploring, discovering meaning through small things in nature. Witnessing the expansion of the internet, I was fascinated by peoples’ desire to want “things” and questioned why we needed these
          “things” to achieve success. It was through my time hiking mountains, traversing rivers and going on adventures that I developed the need to question how and why we do things; to question whether the route we take is the best one. I continued to
          apply this questioning to my life as I grew older, never settling on something without giving it proper thought. Having a two-year experience at Publicis proved that I am an individual with a CAN-DO attitude, good time - management skills and
          critical thinking. This lead to create and maintain good client relationships as well as launching and delivering multiple 360 marketing campaigns.</p></td>
